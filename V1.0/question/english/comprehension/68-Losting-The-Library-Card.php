<p>Lisa loved   to  read! Every time    her Mom took    her to  
the bookstore,she would buy two books.  By  the time    she
went    to  bed,    Lisa had    already read    one of  them.</p>
<p>Mom  said    to  Lisa    the next    day,    “I  think   we  need to get 
you your    own library card.”  “Wow!”  cried   Lisa.   “I’ve   always  
wanted  a library   card.”</p>
<p>The  next    day after   school, Mom took    Lisa    to  the 
library to  get her a card. The lady    at  the desk    asked Momto 
fill    out a paper and then    asked   Lisa to print her   name.</p>
<p>She  
then told Lisa  how many    books   she could   borrow on   her card.   Lisa    was so  excited! She    could   
hardly  wait    to search   the many    shelves of  books.  Lisa’s  favorite    books   were    mysteries.  She 
liked   to  solve   the mystery in  her head    and see if  she was right   when    she got to  the end of  the 
story.  Her other   favorite    books   were    onesthat    took    her to faraway  places.</p>
<p>Lisa had three   books   to  return  the next day    and was excited to  take    out three   more.   
However,    when    Lisa    got to  the library,she didn’t  have    her card.   “Oh no!” Lisa   said    to  the lady    
at  the desk.   “I  can’t   find    my  library card!”  “I’m    sorry,” said    the lady. “I    can’t   let you take    any 
books   without your    card.”  Lisa    left    the library feeling very sad and    also    worried what    her Mom 
would   say when    she told    her she lost    her card.</p>
<p>When Lisa    got home,   Mom told    Lisa    that    a   boy came    to  the house   with    her library card,
and he  said    he  found   it  on  the sidewalk    near    the library.    “It must    have    dropped out of  one of  
the books   I   was carrying,”  said    Lisa.</p>
<p>“You were    lucky   that    boy found your  card,”  said    Mom.    </p>
<p>“You need    to  be  very    careful.”</p>
<p>“Having  a library   card    is  a   big responsibility.”    Lisa    said,   “I  think   I   
will    keep    it  in  my  wallet.” Mom    said, “Let’s    go  back    to  the library and get those   books   you 
wanted.”    “Sounds great,” said    Lisa.   When    they    got to  the library, Mom    decided to  get some    
books   too. While  they    were    in  the library,    Mom told    Lisa    the boy that    found   her card    was
sitting at  the round   table.  Lisa    went    over    to  him and said,   “Thank  you for findingmy   card.”  He  
told    Lisa he was glad    to  help, and they  both    looked  for some    mystery books   together.   Lisa    had 
her books,  her card, and   a   new friend too!</p>
