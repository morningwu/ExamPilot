<p>Rachel and Renee are nine year old twins. However, they do not look identical. Rachel 
has brown hair and brown eyes, while Renee has blond hair and blue 
eyes. For the longest time, the twins were begging their mom to have 
a pet. Their choices for a pet were as different as they were.</p>

<p>This is where the problem began. Rachel would say, “A dog is a 
better pet than a hamster because you can teach a dog tricks and run 
in the park with him.” Renee would say, “A hamster would make the 
best pet because we wouldn’t have to walk the hamster, and we 
could sit and watch him run around on his wheel.” Mom said they 
needed to sit down together and make a list of each pet they talked 
about, and how they would care for that pet. “A pet is a lot of responsibility,” said Mom. 
“Someone has to make sure there is always food and water.”</p>
<p>The girls agreed, and sat down that night to make their list. After school the next day, 
they went to Mr. Riley’s Pet Shop and asked Mr. Riley to see some puppies and hamsters. The 
girls were going to have to spend the money they saved from birthdays and Christmas 
together to buy their pet. Mr. Riley showed them a cute brown beagle puppy and a white 
poodle. He also showed them a brown and white hamster. The girls brought the list they 
made the night before and asked Mr. Riley many questions on how to care for each pet. </p>
<p>Finally, the girls said, “Mr. Riley, we have made our decision.” “We will take that cute white 
bunny with the adorable pink nose!” Mr. Riley was so surprised. “How did you decide on a 
rabbit?” “We both like rabbits, and he looks so sad, and we know he is waiting for someone to 
take him and love him.” “With both of us, he will get double the love!”</p>
<p>Mr. Riley got the rabbit, the cage, and some straw for them to make sure they had 
everything they would need to care for the rabbit. “Do you have a name picked out for him?” 
Rachel said, “We are going to call him “Double Trouble” because of us being twins.” Mr. Riley 
laughed, and the girls carried Double Trouble to his new home where he would be taken good 
care of and given lots of love. They set up his cage in the garage, checked on him to be sure he 
was happy, and played with him often. Their dream of getting a pet had finally come true! </p>
