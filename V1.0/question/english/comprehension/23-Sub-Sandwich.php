<p>Rory was hungry like a wolf. He was ready to destroy some sandwiches. He decided that a sub 
sandwich was the only thing that could satisfy his intense hunger, so he went to the local sub shop just down 
the street. This place was nice, because they knew him by name.</p>

<p>The worker called out his name and said hello when he walked in the door. When the door bells 
chimed and shut behind him, Rory smiled and settled into line, staring at the menu board. There were a lot of 
choices, and the smell of cheeses and herb breads already had his mouth watering.</p>
<p>When it was his turn, he chose the bread first, having considered his choices while he waited. “I’ll take 
a super 18 inch on Italian Herb and Cheese Bread.”</p>
<p>The worker pulled the bread from the warmer, then masterfully sliced and prepared the extra-long loaf 
of tasty bread. “What kind of meats?”</p>
<p>“I’ll have grilled chicken and roast beef today.” The ham and turkey looked good, too, as did the 
meatballs, but he didn’t want them this time</p>
<p>The sliced meats were rolled and placed on the sliced bread. “And what sort of cheese would you 
like?”</p>
<p>“I want the pepper jack and provolone cheeses mixed together,” Rory decided. Those were layered on 
carefully, alternating as they were spaced out along the sandwich bread. “Toast that for me, if you would.”</p>
<p>The worked nodded, grabbed a toaster platter, shoveled the sandwich on there, and then placed it in 
the toaster oven. A press of a button and a few moments later, it was ready. It came out hot and steaming, 
with the bread edges turned a nice crusty brown, and the cheese melted and gooey.</p>
<p>“What veggies and sauces will we be putting for this sandwich, Rory?”</p>
<p>“I want everything except pickles and extra tomatoes,” Rory answered. He watched hungrily as the 
lettuce, tomato, onion, green peppers, spinach, olives, and banana peppers were spread across the sandwich.
Now it was time for sauces. “I’ll take the spicy wasabi mayo and a touch of southwest sauce. Finish it with 
some parmesan cheese sprinkled on top, oregano, and some black pepper.”</p>
<p>“You’re going all out today.” The worker said, following the directions carefully. When the sandwich 
was finished, he packed all the toppings in carefully so it could be cut into thirds. Then he wrapped it in waxed 
paper and slid it into a plastic bag. “Would you like any chips or drinks?”</p>
<p>Rory shook his head. “No, thank you; I just need the sandwich.”</p>
<p>The worker nodded, punched a few buttons on the cash register, 
and announced, “That’ll be eight twenty-seven.”</p>
<p>Rory paid with a ten, and collected his change, leaving the coins as a 
tip, while keeping the one dollar bill. Then he waved and headed out to the 
car for his first bite of a huge sandwich. It tasted just as good as it had 
smelled and looked. It hit the spot.</p>
