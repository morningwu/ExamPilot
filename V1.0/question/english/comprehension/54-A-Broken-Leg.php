<p>All the kids were getting ready to go outside for 
recess. Miss Riley had talked about playground rules 
with her class on the first day of school. “No jumping
off the swings,” said Miss Riley. “You could get hurt.”
“What other rules did we talk about?” Miss Riley 
asked the class. “No pushing or shoving,” said Tyler. 
“That’s correct.”</p>
<p>After reviewing the playground rules, the class 
headed outside. It was a beautiful sunny day and only 
the third day of school. The girls went off into a circle 
and started playing Duck, Duck, Goose. Some of the 
boys were playing tag. Robbie and Jeff decided they 
wanted to go on the swings. “Watch me jump off,” said Robbie. “Don’t jump,” said Jeff. </p>
<p>“Remember what Miss Riley said.” “She’s not looking,” said Robbie. “She won’t know.” Just 
then Robbie jumped and landed on his leg and let out a huge cry! “Help,” he yelled. “I can’t 
move my leg.” All the kids started to run toward Robbie, as well as Miss Riley.</p>
<p>“What 
happened?” asked Miss Riley. “Robbie jumped from the swing, and I told him not to,” said Jeff. 
Robbie’s eyes filled with tears. He was in a lot of pain. “It looks to me you have a broken leg,”
said Miss Riley. “Robbie, why did you jump from the swing after we talked about this in class?”
Robbie did not answer. She told Jeff to go inside and get the school nurse.</p>
<p>Miss Tanner came 
out and said she called the ambulance to come get Robbie. After they took Robbie to the 
hospital, it was time for the class to go back inside. Miss Riley had another talk with the class 
about following directions and the rules for the playground. “What have you learned from 
what happened today to Robbie?” asked Miss Riley. Lucy raised her hand and said, “We need 
to listen to the rules and follow them so we don’t get hurt.”</p>
<p>“Very good,”said Miss Riley.</p>
<p>“If 
Robbie would have listened to my directions and not jumped off the swing, he would not have 
broken his leg.” “I hope you have all learned something from this.” “You can play outside and 
have fun without getting hurt.” “Now, let’s make some cards for Robbie to cheer him up,” said 
Miss Riley.</p>
<p>“I’ll take them to him after school and see how he is doing.”</p>
