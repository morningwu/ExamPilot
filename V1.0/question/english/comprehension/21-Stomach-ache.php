<p>Jason had a bad stomach ache. It was the worst feeling ever. Sometimes it felt like 
pins and needles poking into his belly. Other times it felt like someone was reaching into 
his stomach, making a fist, and twisting mightily</p>

<p>The problem was, he wasn’t sure what had caused it. He hadn’t eaten any bad 
food he hadn’t thought. He didn’t think he’d eaten anything really spicy or sour, either. 
He wasn’t even really gassy. There was no telling what had caused it, but he certainly
wished it was all over soon.</p>
<p>The feeling had come on about lunch time, and it’d lasted all the rest of the school 
day. Then, on the bus ride home he’d been sweating and gritting his teeth against the 
pain. Every bump that had jostled him around had been like agony.</p>
<p>When he went home that night, he couldn’t even it dinner, because his stomach 
hurt so badly. His mother became very concerned. She checked his temperature and 
found him to have a fever of 102 degrees! Even worse, the pain was getting sharper and 
seemed to have moved down and to his right side. </p>
<p>Suddenly, a word that he’d never heard before came out: appendicitis. Everyone 
in his family got very serious looks – even his mean, older sister – and he got rushed to 
the hospital. He didn’t know what it was, but the doctor explained it very seriously while 
his parents listened.</p>
<p>It seemed that part of his digestive tract had gotten very 
infected and they’d have to remove it surgically before it got 
too dangerous. That would take the pain away, and he could 
live without it. He didn’t know he could lose body parts and 
still live, but anything that took away the pain would be great!</p>
<p>His mother held his hand as they gave him a shot that 
put him to sleep, and when he woke up, groggy and sore, she 
was waiting for him again. It took a few days, but he quickly 
felt back to normal. It was so good to have the stomach ache 
gone finally! All this kids at school wanted to see his scar, too.</p>
