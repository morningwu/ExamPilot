<p>Patty hated broccoli. She stared at the weird tree-shaped 
vegetable sitting next to her yucky pork chop and her boring salad. It 
was horrible. It looked like squirrel food. How could her mother 
expect her to eat it? The only thing worse than broccoli was Brussels 
sprouts. Those things looked like little, green, alien brains</p>

<p>“GROSS!” Patty shouted, pushing her plate away.</p>
<p>“Patty.” Her father said her name sternly. He liked his dinner, 
and he hated bad table manners.</p>
<p>"Where are my hamburgers and fries? Why can’t I have 
chicken nuggets? Or how about pizza for once?” Patty whined.</p>
<p>“We had pizza on the weekend. During the week we need to eat healthy to balance out the 
junk food we have sometimes.” Mother explained.</p>
<p>“How about some soda with dinner, then?” Patty grumbled. “Milk is icky.”</p>
<p>“Patty.” Father repeated her name again. He was starting to get his irritated face. The vein in 
the middle of his forehead stood out when he was angry.</p>
<p>Patty sighed and pulled her plate back to her. She took a hesitant bite of broccoli and promptly 
spit it back on the plate.</p>
<p>“Patty! Room! Now!” Father barked at her. He’d had enough.</p>
<p>Scolded, she ran to the other room, slammed the door, and threw herself on her bed. She cried 
for a few minutes, but then a thought occurred to her. Her parents would feel sad and get her some 
food she actually liked if she didn’t eat anything for days. They’d feel guilty and give in to her wishes. 
She smiled to herself, imagining her parents feeding her ice cream whenever a tear threatened to 
drop from her eye. </p>
<p>Mom tried to get her to eat later that evening, but she refused. Patty didn’t eat breakfast the 
next day either. When lunch came around, she was starving, but she wouldn’t eat anything that 
wasn’t fried or sweet. They didn’t offer her anything special when she didn’t eat. That surprised her.</p>
<p>By the time dinner came around, she could hardly move. Her stomach growled loudly and she 
felt very weak. She was dizzy with hunger and barely had the energy to drag herself to the table. 
Suddenly, vegetables didn’t look so bad. </p>
<p>And you know what? They didn’t taste so bad either. Patty had seconds of mashed potatoes 
and corn that night. She went to bed with a full stomach. She still wanted pizza and chips and junk 
food, but she could wait until the weekend.</p>
