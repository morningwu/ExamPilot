<p>Jason paused as he walked down the street. He walked this 
particular stretch of road often, but he did not ever remember seeing 
the vines that covered the bushes next to the road. He supposed they 
might have always been there, but with the recent rains and the strong 
sun, perhaps they had grown larger and longer. Now, the vines seemed 
to cover everything.</p>

<p>He looked closer. Bunches of dark berries or fruit seemed to be clustered under the broad 
leaves. That was odd. The dark berries almost looked like grapes, though they were pretty small.
Grapes didn’t grow here, did they?</p>

<p>Jason shook his head and finished his walk, but on the way back home, he stopped to look at 
the fruit once more. Convinced that they were indeed grapes, he snapped a bunch off the vine along 
with a couple leaves.</p>

<p>Back home, Jason compared the leaves and fruit to the pictures he found online. He read up on 
the fruits that grew locally in his state, and checked several resources to help correctly identify the 
plant. Local wildlife organizations had whole pages dedicated to edible wild fruits and plants, as well 
as imposter plants that looked similar but were actually bad for you.</p>


<p>After much research, he decided they were indeed wild grapes. He pinched one between his 
fingers and felt the dark skin separate from the flesh inside. Four little seeds were inside the jellied 
center of the grape. He taste-tested one carefully, savoring the tartness of the supposed wild grape.</p>

<p>Then he began waiting an hour to see if there was any sort of reaction, just in case he’d made a 
mistake. Later, he had no stomach pains, there was no swelling of his throat or tongue, and he hadn’t 
broken out in hives or had any other sort of reaction. The grapes were safe!</p>

<p>He ate a few more and then got a bag. He also took some scissors with him to cut the vines 
where needed. Sometimes the skinny tendrils of vines that held the grapes were surprisingly strong. 
With his dog at his side this time, he collected all he could find.</p>

<p>Afterward, he rinsed and ate a few, but most of them he crushed to make juice. The juice 
needed sugar, but it was sweet already, because it tasted wild and natural, not to mention that it was 
free!</p>

<p>From then on, he kept an eye out for other local edible plants. He learned a lot about plants 
and wildlife, and he got some wonderful treats as he did it.</p>
