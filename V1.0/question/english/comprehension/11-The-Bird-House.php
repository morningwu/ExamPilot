<p>
Grandpa’s hobby was making birdhouses. He always said, “A
man has to keep busy to stay out of trouble.” Leigh wasn’t sure how 
much trouble Grandpa could get into anyway, since he was such a 
nice guy, but she tried to listen to his advice. Besides, she liked to 
help him on his birdhouses.</p>

<p>Grandpa’s shop was full of well-oiled and carefully-kept tools. 
Whenever he used something, he put it back in exactly the right 
place. He had rules about how he treated his tools, because he 
hated buying something new if the old one still worked. He also 
made sure to clean up his messes each time he worked on 
something.</p>

<p>It wasn’t too fun cleaning up, but it was nice to watch him cut boards to exact 
lengths. It was nice to see the drill put in holes for screws to go in cleanly. It was like 
being a doctor, but with wood. The best part of building was seeing all the pieces come 
together in the final form. Yet, even then it wasn’t done.</p>

<p>The last steps always included lacquer or paint, to help protect Grandpa’s hard 
work from the weather. His birdhouses lasted for years. If he didn’t coat them properly, 
the sun and rain would turn the wood grey and weak in a short period of time. No, he 
always made sure to do things right. Even if he put rocks or other cute decorations on 
them, it was done right and made to last.</p>


<p>Grandpa was a hard worker, but he was also smart and 
generous. He let Leigh keep the birdhouses sometimes, but 
only if he got to help hang it up or set the post for it. It had to 
be done just right, after all.</p>

<p>The birdhouses were a great way to learn about 
woodworking, hard work, taking care of what you have, and
about birds. The absolute best thing about building 
birdhouses was that Leigh spent some time with Grandpa.</p>
