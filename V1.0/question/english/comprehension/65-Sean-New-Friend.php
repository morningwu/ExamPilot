<p>Sean made a new friend at school this year, his name was Caleb and they had 
lots of fun together. They skateboarded, ran races and even played Wii. One day 
Caleb invited Sean to a Passover.</p>

<p>“What is Passover?” Sean asked.</p>
<p>“It is a very special Jewish holiday,” Caleb said with a smile, “You will like it, I 
promise!”</p>
<p>The Passover was in a large room and many 
people were there. They were dressed up like you 
would dress up if you were going to go to church. 
Caleb and his father wore a small, round hat on their 
heads. Caleb’s mother put a scarf on her head, as she 
lit some candles and prayed. Sean couldn’t understand 
her words.</p>
<p>Caleb asked his father why this night was different 
than all other nights and his father told the story of 
Moses. Sean remembered that story from Sunday 
School. God told Moses to say, “Let my people go.”
The king said, “No,” so God sent frogs and flying bugs 
and all kinds of other things to bother the king until he 
changed his mind and set God’s people free.</p>
<p>At the Passover they drank grape juice and ate 
crackers that had stripes and holes all over it, they called it Matzo. They dipped some 
green leaves in some salt water, and they tasted something that burned so bad it made 
Sean’s eyes have tears in them.</p>
<p>Caleb said this 
was to remind them of the bad times when there 
was a bad king bossing them around. After that, 
they tasted something sweet made of apples and 
Caleb said that helps them remember the 
happiness of being free! </p>
<p>They sang some fun 
songs, and Caleb’s dad wrapped a piece of Matzo 
in a napkin. Then do you know what they did? 
His mother hid it! Then after dinner the children 
got to go find it and Sean was the lucky one.</p>
<p>He 
was the first to find it and he won two whole 
dollars! Sean thought this was so fun that he 
hoped Caleb would invite him again next year, but 
now, maybe he should invite Caleb to his house 
for Easter! What do you think?</p>
