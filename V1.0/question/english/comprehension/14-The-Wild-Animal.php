<p>Tobey had always liked zoos. It was great to see animals that didn’t 
live around his house. Around his house he could see cows or horses, but 
he couldn’t see zebras or lions. He could see cardinals and blue jays, but he 
couldn’t see monkeys or gators. Zoos were a great and fascinating way to 
spend his weekend learning about animals.</p>

<p>Today, he was trying to go to something a little different. He’d 
learned that near his house there was an animal shelter. It wasn’t a regular 
shelter, though. He’d been to those before, where you could adopt dogs, 
cats, and even an occasional pot-bellied pig or goat. This place he was 
going to had lions and tigers and bears. It wasn’t any regular shelter.</p>

<p>As he arrived, he was surprised, because he heard lions even from the parking lot. The place 
was small, but nicely-kept. It was clean and the volunteers working at the entry were very helpful. He 
and his family toured the place at their own pace, examining the cages and habitats the animals lived 
in.</p>

<p>Tobey was immediately struck by the differences between this place and a zoo. Zoos had 
beautiful habitats set up for each animal, but you could not get near the animals at all. At this shelter, 
he was almost close enough to reach out and touch the animals, even if there were two fences 
between him and the animals. There weren’t as many people, either, so it seemed like a more 
personal experience. The paths were narrow and covered with trees that made the animals feel more 
at home and gave them shade.</p>


<p>It was interesting to stare a lion in the eyes when you could almost reach out and touch it. It 
was fun to watch the bears pace back and forth and wiggle their lips at you with great expressions. 
They were silly creatures. Then there were leopards lazing in the midday heat and monkeys grooming 
themselves. It was a very neat experience.</p>

<p>The best part about the place was the stories. Each animal had a story posted up on the side of 
their cage. Each had been rescued from abuse or taken when they were no longer wanted. These 
were hard luck stories with a happy ending. Someone at this shelter had stepped up to take care of 
the animals, and now Tobey could enjoy meeting them and learn from them</p>

<p>When it was finally time to go, they all thanked the volunteers and made a donation. Shelters 
always needed money, food for animals, and help. It made them feel good to be helping out any way 
they could. It was a great place, and Tobey couldn’t wait to return.</p>
