<p>Ethan’s eyes grew wide. This store had the newest Super-MegaChanger! “Mom, mom!” Ethan cried excitedly.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear?” She wasn’t really listening, but he got her attention by 
pulling on her arm.</p>
<p>“I want that!” He pointed at the toy, all shiny and blue in its plastic 
package. He smiled as he thought about using scissors to open the child-proof 
packaging, releasing the toy into his large collection at home. </p>

<p>Ethan’s mother frowned at the package and looked completely 
uninterested. “No, dear, not today.” Her answer was simple and final.</p>
<p>Shock ran through his body as if he’d been slapped across the face. 
“What?” His dreams of playing with the newest Super-Mega-Changer were 
vanishing like clouds blown away on a windy day.</p>
<p>“Not today, dear.” Mother repeated, checking off something inconsequential from her shopping list. 
Who cared about eggs, bacon, cheese, and milk when he didn’t have the newest Super-Mega-Changer?</p>
<p>Ethan inhaled deeply and let out a bloodcurdling cry. “I WANT THAT!” He howled.</p>
<p>His mother stopped what she was doing and looked at him as if he’d just grown twenty feet tall and his
skin had taken on angry shade of glowing green. “What do you think you’re doing, young man?” </p>
<p>“I want that!” He repeated. </p>
<p>“You will not make a scene.” Mother hissed, clutching his arm with her talon-like nails digging in. She 
dragged him bodily away from the toy section and back into the grocery section of the store. </p>
<p>“I want that really bad?” Ethan whined, slipping free. He ran back to the toy shelf and grabbed the toy.</p>
<p>Mother barked an angry laugh. Her eyes were wild, like a horse ridden too hard. She was ready to rear 
up and crush him beneath her powerful hooves. He cowered away from her imminent wrath.</p>
<p>Instead, she took a calming breath. “Another word of this, and we shall have to see about weeks of 
extra chores and grounding on top of that. I thought we’d grown past these little tantrums? “</p>
<p>That hurt. Her tone suggested that he was little more than a toddler, and it burned like acid thrown 
upon his skin. Was he really being that unreasonable? All he wanted was one toy, and it wasn’t like it was… he 
strained to see the price tag. Wow, it was quite expensive! It was $37.99. That was like two month’s allowance 
for him, and that was if he skipped out on candy and comic books.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Mom.” </p>
<p>Her mouth twitched, ready to say something snappy, because she was clearly expecting more arguing. 
“Maybe you can get it some other time.” </p>
<p>Ethan nodded and looked at the shopping list. “What can I help you get?” Sometimes it was easier to 
be helpful, especially after making trouble. It helped parents get over the mistakes you’d just made.</p>
