<p>Henry liked Spring Holidays, because he liked the weather. 
Sometimes it was hard to get excited about May Day, or President’s Day, 
but St. Patrick’s Day was fun. It was amusing to wear green and eat green 
foods, even if he wasn’t Irish. Easter was a good holiday, too. You could see 
the Easter Rabbit, hunt for eggs, find candy, or go to church if you wanted. 
April Fool’s was also pretty fun. Henry liked playing jokes on his family and 
friends.</p>

<p>Sandra liked Summer Holidays, like Independence Day. She always went to the air show to see 
airplanes or hot air balloons. In the evening they’d shoot off fireworks. Mother’s Day and Father’s Day 
were usually in the summer, or close to it, too. On Cinco de Mayo, her family ate Mexican food, just 
for fun. On Memorial Day, Sandra went to visit her grandfather’s grave. It was a sad day, but a good
day to remember.</p>

<p>Judith loved Fall holidays most. Sweetest Day wasn’t that popular, but it was a nice day to be 
kind to the poor, and sometimes she got candy. Halloween was such a great time. You could dress up 
in costumes and go trick-or-treating. Things were all decorated in very scary ways, and it was fun to 
watch scary movies with your family. Thanksgiving was just a few weeks later. She always ate so much 
turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, and sweet potato casserole. Between Halloween’s candy and 
Thanksgiving’s turkey, it had to be the best food season of the year.</p>

<p>Winter holidays were Thomas’ favorites. Christmas was a great 
time to be with family, to eat wonderful food, and to give or receive 
gifts. His family often went caroling, and the decorations were 
probably the best of the year. New Year’s was exciting, because 
everyone stayed up late and cheered when the year changed, and 
there were often fireworks. Not only that, but both holidays were sort 
of two days: Christmas Eve had Christmas, and New Year’s Eve had 
New Year’s Day. If you didn’t celebrate those, there was always 
Chanukah or Kwanzaa. Valentines’ Day even fell in the winter, even
though it was February, and on Chinese New Year, his whole family 
ordered takeout from the Chinese Buffet</p>

<p>None of them could decide for certain who had the right opinion, but they all agreed that 
holidays were fun. Some were for seeing people you loved, and others were holidays that reminded 
you to be kind and generous. They were certainly all very fun.</p>
