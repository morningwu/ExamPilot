<p>Robert and his friend, Mike, were headed to 
the amusement park for the day. It had been Mike’s 
birthday, and his mom promised him a day at the 
amusement park with a friend. The boys were so 
excited to try the whirl around ride. Then, it would 
be the rollercoaster.</p>
<p>Mike talked his mom into going 
on the rollercoaster too, but she was so scared all 
she did was scream! The Ferris wheel had always 
been Robert’s favorite. He liked to be high up. He 
especially liked it when the seat came to a stop at 
the top and rocked back and forth.</p>

<p>The boys were hungry so Mike’s mom gave 
them tickets to get cotton candy, hotdogs, and some popcorn. While getting the food, Mike 
saw a boy about his age standing at the whirl around ride. He just stood there and stared. 
“That boy was standing at the whirl around ride when we were on it,” said Mike.</p>
<p>“I wonder 
why he doesn’t go on the ride?” asked Robert. “Maybe he’s scared.” The boy was by himself 
and looked poor. His shirt and jeans were torn and dirty. Even his hair was messy. After the 
boys finished their food, they walked over to Mike’s mom and told her about the boy.</p>
<p>“Can we 
do something to help him?” asked Mike. “What do you want to do?” his mom asked. “Let’s 
give him the extra tickets we have, and we can give him a ticket for a hotdog.” Mike and 
Robert went over to the boy and said they had some extra tickets, and he could have them. </p>
<p>The boy gave them the biggest smile and said, “Thanks that would be great!” “We have some 
extra food tickets too.” “Wow, I would really like a hotdog,” said the boy. He said his name 
was Chris and that he comes to the amusement park often, but he doesn’t have the money to 
go on the rides. “I just watch everyone else and wish I could go on all the rides.” </p>
<p>” Mike’s mom 
came over and told the boys it was getting late. “This is Chris,” said Mike to his mom. “It’s nice 
to meet you Chris.” “Well boys, we need to head home.” “It’s been a long day.” They said 
goodbye to Chris and left. Mike’s mom told the boys what they did for Chris was very special. 
“You both brightened a boy’s day that is less fortunate than you.” “I’m proud of you both.”</p><hr/>
