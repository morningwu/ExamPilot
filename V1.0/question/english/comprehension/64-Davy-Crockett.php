<p>Have you ever heard of Davy Crockett? He was a great 
hero and a brave man. He was born in the hills of Tennessee 
in 1786. He had five brothers and three sisters. They lived in 
a cabin made of logs from trees that had been chopped down 
and the house only had two rooms. Their bathroom was 
outside, it was called an outhouse.</p>
<p>Davy’s shirt, pants, and shoes were all made from a deer, it was called buckskin 
and his favorite hat was made of a raccoon, it was called a Coonskin Cap. Davy grew up 
learning to hunt at a very young age; his family needed him to help bring food home to 
eat. When Davy was old enough he was able to have a gun. He named his gun “Old 
Betsy”. It was a long rifle and was about 6 feet long. </p>
<p>When Davy was thirteen-years old, his dad wanted him to go to school to learn to 
read and write, but Davy only went four days. There was a bully at his school that was 
older than he was and the boy jumped on him and beat him up. So Davy didn’t want to 
go back to school. His dad wanted him to go back and he spanked him with a hickory 
switch; Davy ran away.</p>
<p>Davy had to work very hard so that he could eat and have a place to live. It wasn’t 
easy being away from his mom and dad. One day he returned home and everyone was 
glad to see him. </p>
<p>When Davy grew up he was one of the best hunters around. When he was nearly 
twenty-years old Davy got married and had a family. In 1813 he had to go fight the 
Indians in the War of 1812. His men were starving and Davy went hunting and got all 
his men something to eat.</p>
<p>Some years later Davy went to Congress to make sure that Tennessee got to have a 
say in the government. He was what is called a Representative because he represented 
the people in his state.</p>
<p>In October of 1835, when Davy was 49-years old, he decided to go to Texas. 
Texas did not belong to the United States at that time, it belonged to Mexico. But Texas 
wanted to be free. So Davy and his men decided to help Texas. They went to a place in 
San Antonio, called The Alamo, and there they went against Santa Anna, who was the 
one in charge of Mexico’s army. Things looked very bad for those in the Alamo and they 
were given a chance to run away. But Davy and his men decided to stay no matter what. 
They were killed there in the Alamo. But because of them, Texas became free! Texans 
will never forget the Alamo and those brave men like Davy Crockett who died there so 
they could be free.</p>
