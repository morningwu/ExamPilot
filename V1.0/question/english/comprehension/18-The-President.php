                        <div class="passage">

<p>I was born on February 22, 1732, in Wakefield, VA. I had two 
brothers and two sisters. When I was eleven, my father died and I went 
to live with my older brother at Mount Vernon. I went to school, but 
never went to college. When I was fourteen years old I had planned to 
become a sailor on a large ship, but my mother was so sad that I just 
had to change my mind. I loved my mom too much to make her cry.</p>

<p>When I was seventeen, I became a land surveyor and I enjoyed 
hunting for a sport. When I wasn’t hunting, I enjoyed reading. When I 
was nineteen, I joined the Army as a Major and later went on to become 
Commander-in-Chief of all the forces of the Virginia Colony. I fought 
in the French and Indian War, which lasted seven years, and then I 
resigned my commission. Just a few days later, I married Martha.</p>

<p>I was twenty-seven years old. Martha was a widow and had two children 
whom I adopted. Later I had two grandchildren as well. We lived at 
Mt. Vernon, which I had inherited from my brother; I was happy just 
being a planter. I attended the First and Second Continental Congresses 
in Philadelphia. They appointed me head of the Army. I would accept no pay, because it was 
my privilege to serve the first American Army. Soon the Declaration of Independence was 
written and signed and America became a country. The thirteen colonies became thirteen states 
and then we were at war with the British. We fought for eight years. I was forty-three years old 
when it started. This war was called the Revolutionary War.</p>

<p>On November 2, 1783, I said good-bye to my Army and on Dec. 23, I resigned my 
commission as Commander-in-Chief. Some people were asking me to make myself King of 
America, but I told them to never speak of such things.</p>

<p>Later, I was the leader of a great convention held in Philadelphia. We drew up a 
Constitution to tell how we would run our government and how we would choose a person to be 
President of the United States. We held elections for President and I won the election and John 
Adams became my Vice President; I was fifty-seven years old. I served two four-year terms 
and then the people wanted me to serve again, but Isaid “no”, it was time for someone else to 
take over. The capital was not Washington at that time, but New York,so this is where I lived. 
I was the only President that did not live in the White House. When I became President, we had 
thirteen states. At the end of my eight years we had added five more states! They were North 
Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee.</p>

<p>After my Farewell Address to the nation in Sept of 1796, I returned home to Mt. Vernon. 
I lived there until I died on December 14, 1799 at age 67. Have you guessed who I am yet? I 
am George Washington!</p>
