<p>I am so excited!    Mom and Dad are taking  me  to  my  first   circus. All 
the kids    at  school  have already    been    to  a   circus, but not me. When    we  
had our “circle share   time”   at  school  on  Friday  afternoon,  our teacher,    
Miss    Alexander   asked   each    of  us  what    special plans,  if  any,    we  had for 
the weekend.        Mary    was going   to  the mall,   Billy   had a   championship
ball    game,   Todd    was going   to  his swimming    lesson, and when    Miss    
Alexander   got to  me, I   was so  ready   to  tell    everyone    what    I   was going   to  
do! “I’m    going   to  my  first   circus!”    I   said    so  proudly.    Miss    Alexander   
thought that    was a   great   plan    to  have    for the weekend.</p>
<p>It   was finally Saturday, and   off we  went    to  the 
circus. We  found   our seats   and watched three
huge    elephants   walk    through some    big hoops   that    
two men were    holding.    Next,   the clowns  came    out 
on  unicycles   and rode    all around  the circus  tent.   
Some    were    blowing loud    funny   horns,  while   others
did tricks  on  their   unicycles.  The best    part    was 
when    the trapeze artists walked  high    above us on 
a   very    thin    and tiny    wire.   People  held    their   breath  
as  they watched    the trapeze artists balance 
themselves. They    didn’t  even    look    scared! </p>
<p>Dad  got some    cotton  candy   and peanuts for me, and I   shared  them    
with    my  little  sister, Marie.  Out came    some    beautiful   gray    horses  with    
riders  that    were    doing   some    tricks, including   riding  sideways    on  the 
horses. “Wow!”  said    Marie.  “I  sure    wish    I   could   ride    like    that!”  We  took    
many    pictures,   even    some    with    the funny   clowns.</p>
<p>Finally, it  was time    to  go  home,   but I   will    never   forget  the most    
fantastic   time,   my  first   circus!I    can’t   wait    to  share   the best    weekend 
ever    with    everyone back   at  school  on  Monday. I   will    bring   the pictures    
to  show Miss   Alexander   and the rest    of  the class. They will    feel    like    they    
went    to  the circus  too!</p><hr/>
