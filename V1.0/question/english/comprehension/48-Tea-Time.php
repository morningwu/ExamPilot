<p>Polly    sat across   from   her  friend Sara.   Sara    was lifting a    teacup and smiling.    Polly   smiled  back    
and  tried   to look     dainty as   she    lifted  a    biscuit     to  her    mouth.  She  nibbled     carefully, lifting  her     pinky  
finger  as  she did so.</p>

<p>“This    is  so  nice.   I’m glad    you invited me.”    Sara    gushed.</p>
<p>“I’m glad    you came.”  Polly   replied.    “It is  so  hard    to  find    nice    company to  have    over    for tea.”</p>
<p>“Who do  you normally    have    tea with?”  Sara    asked.</p>
<p>Polly    frowned over    at  one of  the other   chairs. There   were    four    chairs  around  the table.  She sat 
in   one.   Her  friend  Polly   sat    across   from    her.   On   her    left    was Mr. Wiggles,     her     tabby   cat.   The  other  
chair   was empty.</p>
<p>“Normally,   I   have    tea with    Mr. Wiggles,    or  sometimes   my  brother.” Polly answered.</p>
<p>“Mr. Wiggles doesn’t seem    like    he  would   like    tea.” Even  though  he  purred, he  didn’t  drink   tea.</p>
<p>“He  doesn’t.    I   have    to  put cat food    in  his cup."</p>
<p>The   two    girls   giggled as  Mr. Wiggles ate  his     canned  cat     food    from    his     teacup.    It   smelled    like    
fish,   which   wasn’t  very nice   for a   tea party,  but he  looked  pretty  with    his tiara   on.</p>
<p>“We  should  invite  another friend  over    to  sit with    us.”    Sara    suggested.  “How    about   Melanie?”</p>
<p>Polly    shook   her head    strongly.   “She’s  mean    to  me.”</p>
<p>“Carly?”</p>
<p>She  thinks  she’s   too cool.” Polly    answered.</p>
<p>“Jane?”</p>
<p>Polly    shook   her head    again.  “Bad    manners.”</p>
<p>“Stephanie?”</p>
<p>“She lives   too far.” Polly whined.</p>
<p>Sara sighed. She was running out of  ideas,  and her friend’s    pickiness   was bothering   her.    “Bea?”</p>
<p>“She lives   next    door,   but she’s   not too bad.”</p>
<p>“Oh, she’s   on  vacation,   I   think.” Sara    suddenly    remembered.</p>
<p>“I    guess   we’ll   have    to  settle  for     my  brother     then.” Polly    looked  disappointed.   The     idea    of  a  
bigger  tea party   had excited her.    “Maybe  we  can make    him wear    a   wig and white   gloves.”</p>
<p>“Polly,  that’s  mean.”</p>
<p>“He’s    my  brother,    so  I   can be  mean.” Polly    insisted.</p>
<p>“Just    let him be  a   gentleman.  It  would   be  nice    to  take    tea with    a   gentleman.” Sara    replied.</p>
<p>“You know,   that’s  a   good    idea.”</p>
<p>“The less    you change  people, the better.”    Sara    advised her friend. Being   a   good    friend  meant   
giving  good    advice.</p>
