<p>Henry was so nervous. He hadn’t even been able to sleep</p>
<p>Now, as the big yellow school bus rolled up to the school, 
he felt like a prisoner being dropped off at prison. There was a 
fence around school. There were people telling him what to do 
and when to do it. There were big, mean kids waiting to pound 
him. He couldn’t leave when he wanted to, either.</p>
<p>Henry swallowed anxiously as the kids around him got out 
of their seats and began heading down the aisle to the open 
door. As he walked down the steps to exit, he wondered what his teacher would be like.</p>
<p>It would probably be a scary man this year. The guy would be like 300 pounds, like a football
player. He’d have a shaved head and hairy arms, like a bear. He’d growl and flash his sharp teeth at 
anyone who didn’t know their multiplication tables. It would be awful.</p>
<p>As he walked up the front steps into the school and the double doors ate him in one giant bite, 
he wondered what school lunch would be like this year. The macaroni and cheese would probably 
stick to the tray, even if he turned it upside down. The canned fruits and vegetables would be like
mush. The pizza would be cardboard with red sauce and rubber cheese. It would be gross.</p>
<p>As he walked down the hall, he wondered about his classmates. How awful would they be? 
They would probably be wild, like gorillas battling for control of the jungle. Each one would be bigger, 
stronger, louder, and meaner than him. They’d smack him around and steal his cookies, because he 
was a weaker version of them. It would be horrible.</p>
<p>As he reached his classroom door, he wondered about homework. Surely he’d get a stack of 
papers like a phone book. His math book would be like one of those old dictionaries that takes two 
men just to lift it. It would be scary.</p>
<p>He stepped into the room. A pretty, young woman stepped over, shook his hand and smiled. 
“I’m Mrs. Stacey. Nice to meet you, Henry, right?”</p>
<p>Henry blinked in surprise. “How’d you know?”</p>
<p>“We’ve been expecting you.” She replied warmly.</p>
<p>Henry glanced around the room. Bright, smiling faces all looked up from their neat desks, and 
they honestly seemed friendly. The room was decorated brightly and nicely, and no one looked like 
they wanted to pound him.</p>
<p>Maybe it wasn’t going to so bad after all, especially since they were serving chicken for lunch.</p>
<p></p>
