<p>Kelly    loves   school, especially  gym class. She  is  a   very    good    
student and enjoys  reading and math.   But,    Kelly   has a   hard    time    in  
gym class.  She is  not good    at  jumping very    far,    she has trouble 
throwing    a   ball,   and she cannot  run really  fast.   Sometimes,  the 
other   kids    in  her gym class   give    her a   hard    time    and make    fun of  
her.    So  why would   Kelly   love    gym class?</p>
<p>Her  teacher,    Mr. Burns,  knows   that    Kelly   has a   hard    time    
doing   certain activities  in  his class.  The reason  Kelly   enjoys  going   
to  gym class   is  because Mr. Burns   always  tells   herto   do  her best.       </p>
<p>Even if  she only    runs    for a   few minutes,    Mr. Burns   says,   “Good   job,    next    time    you will be able    
to  go  a   little  longer.”    Mr. Burns   even    put a   small   box on  the gym floor   so  Kelly   would   be  able to 
practice    jumping over    it. “Great  job,    Kelly!” “You    get better  every   day!”</p>
<p>That night   when    Kelly   finished    dinner, she went    to  her room    and placed some small   
boxes   in  a   row and began   practicing  jumping over    them.   She was able    to  jump    over    three   
boxes!  Kelly   thought to  herself,tomorrow    in  gym class   I   will    be  able    to  jump    over    those boxes.    
And sure    enough, Kelly   did jump over   three   boxes   in  class.  The other   kids    started to  see how 
well    Kelly   was doing and   said    to  her,    “Good   job!”</p>
<p>It   was Tuesday,    and time    for the weekly  relay   race    in  gym class.  Kelly   was scared  that    
she would   not be  able    to  go very far,    or  some    kids    would   laugh   at  her.    But,    when    Mr. Burns   
said,   “Ready, set,    go,”    Kelly   thought to  herself, I  can do  it, I   can do  it. As  Kelly   ran around  the 
track,  she found   herself moving closer   and closerinto first    place!  All of  a   sudden, she heard   
many    cheers and  kids yelling, “Go   Kelly,  you can do  it!” That   was all she needed  to  hear.   Kelly   
ran around  the track as    fast    as  she could, and  headed  for the finish  line.   She made    it! Kelly   
finished    first!  The kids    clapped and cheered for her.    Kelly felt  so  good and    proud   of  herself.</p>
<p>“Thank   you Mr. Burns,” said    Kelly.  “Kelly, you ran the race,   not me.”    “Yes,   but you always  said    I   
could   do  it.”</p>
<p>After    that    day,    Kelly   tried   her hardest at  everything, and the kids    no  longer  laughed or  
made    fun of  her.    In  fact,   when    the kids    needed  someone on  their   team    for jumping or  running,    
Kelly   was the first   person  they picked! She    will    always  remember    Mr. Burns   and the kind    words   
he  said    to  her.    Thanks  to  Mr. Burns,  Kelly   had the confidence  she needed  to  do  anything!</p>
