<p>Halloween was over, and Jessie was wondering what 
to do with all the pumpkins she had left over from the 
holiday. It was a shame to throw them away. They were still 
in good shape. I know she thought to herself, I will make 
some pumpkin pies.</p>

<p>That night Jessie gathered all the ingredients she 
needed to make her pie. She rolled out the dough, mashed 
up the pumpkin, and made sure all the pumpkin seeds were 
taken out. She added some cinnamon and nutmeg as her 
spices. When she was ready, she put the pie in the oven. 
“Wow!” said mom when she came into the kitchen. “That 
sure smells yummy!” “I can’t wait for the pies to finish,” said Jessie. “I want to take some pie 
to Mrs. Johnson.” Mrs. Johnson was Jessie’s next door neighbor who lived alone and didn’t get 
much company.</p>
<p>The pies were finally finished baking, and Jessie took two slices of pie to Mrs. Johnson. 
“Oh Jessie, this pie is so delicious!” “Thank you for bringing me some.” “My church would 
enjoy these pies for their carnival coming up next Saturday,” said Mrs. Johnson. “I have two 
more pumpkins,” said Jessie. “Would you like me to make two pies?” she asked. “That would 
be wonderful,” said Mrs. Johnson.</p>
<p>Jessie made her pumpkin pies, and they sold at the church carnival within the first hour 
the carnival was open. Many people that bought the pies wanted to know where they could 
buy more of the pies that were sold at the carnival. Mrs. Johnson told them her young 
neighbor had made them, but she didn’t know if she was interested in baking anymore, now 
that the “pumpkin season” was coming to an end.</p>
<p>Jessie took orders for more pies after church the next weekend, and she began making 
pies for special events. She made pies for a baby shower, a birthday party, and even a pie for a 
child that made all A’s on his report card. Jessie was so proud of her pies, and her parents 
were even more proud. Jessie continued to make pies for people that had a different event or 
party. Jessie became known as the “Pumpkin Princess” among her friends. </p><hr/>
