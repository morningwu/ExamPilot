<p>Trevor    giggled     as  he  cracked     open    another     can     of  cola.   It  was     his    
fourth  already,    and  he was  feeling    very    hyper.   “I  love    this    stuff. It  makes   
me  bounce  off the walls.”</p>
<p>“It  gives   me  extra   energy   to  party!”    Trevor’s     friend  Kevin   shouted.   
He’d    already had three   cans,   too.</p>
<p>An   idea    came    to  Trevor  suddenly.   “We should  drink   the whole   case.”</p>
<p>“Wow.    All 24  cans?   That’s  a   lot.”   Kevin   grinned at  the thought.</p>
<p>“I   think   if  we  did it, it’d    be  awesome. We’d   have    so  much    fun.”</p>
<p>“What    would   we  do?” Kevin  wondered.</p>
<p>“I   don’t   know,    run     to Mars    and back?”  Trevor  laughed and slurped 
down    another long    sip.</p>
<p>Trevor’s sister, Harriet, walked in  the room    and shook   her head    at  the mess    they    were    making. 
There    were    chips   all     over    the     floor,  their   dirty   feet    were    on  the     coffee  table,  video   games   were   
everywhere, and empty   cans    of  soda    were    starting    to  pile    up.</p>
<p>Harriet  was always  disapproving    of  his behavior.   It  wasn’t  his fault   that    girls   didn’t  know    how to  
have    fun.    “You    guys    are making  a   mess.”</p>
<p>“We’re   drinking    soda    until   we  go  crazy!” Kevin   shouted.</p>
<p>“You mean    until   your    teeth   fall    out of  your    face    and you both    get stomach aches.” She replied,    
snorting.   Older   sisters liked   to  snort   and think   they    were    smarter.</p>
<p>“Yeah,   right.” Trevor  replied.    “We’ll  run miles   around  the neighborhood    and stay    up  for three   
days    beating high    scores.”</p>
<p>“You’ll  be  in  bed by  eleven  and wet the bed if  you drink   too much.”  She warned  them.</p>
<p>Trevor    and     Kevin   laughed     at  her.    “No     way!   We   would   not. You    clearly     do  not     understand 
awesomeness.”</p>
<p>They  both   guzzled  their   soda   and went     to  the     fridge  for    another.    Harriet left     them   alone,  at  
least    for    another couple  hours.  When    she came    back,    they   were    still   playing hard,   but  they   weren’t 
interested  in  drinking    any more.</p>
<p>“I   feel    sick.”  Kevin   whined.</p>
<p>“I   never   want    to  eat another chip    or  drink   another soda    again.”</p>
<p>An   hour    later,  they    both    felt    even    sicker. They    fell    asleep  before  midnight,   as  she’d   predicted.  
Harriet smiled. They’d  learned their   lesson  the hard    way,    especially  when    mom made    them    clean   up  
the next    day.</p>
