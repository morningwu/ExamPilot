<p>It was coming up on Marty’s birthday. He would turn ten in just three days. His mom 
had asked him what he wanted as a gift this year. Marty thought for the past few weeks about 
what he would like. He thought maybe a new bicycle, or maybe a new camera, a new 
basketball, or a telescope. He told his mom his choices 
and asked that he be surprised.” Any of those gifts would 
be great,” he said. Secretly, he hoped for the telescope. 
Marty loved space, stars, and learning about the planets.</p>

<p>Marty’s mom and dad talked about the list of gifts 
one night after Marty went to sleep. Dad said, “I think 
Marty will just get tired of the basketball, and he doesn’t 
take many pictures.” Mom said, “We just bought him a 
new bicycle last Christmas.” However, it was getting a 
little small for Marty since he was growing so fast. “I think 
we should get Marty the telescope,” said dad. “He’s so interested in space and the planets, he 
would like that the best.” “Sounds good,” said mom. Dad told her he would stop by the store 
the next day after work and pick out a telescope for Marty.</p>

<p>Marty’s dad had the telescope in the trunk of his car. He waited until Marty was asleep 
and brought it into the house. “Wow!” said Marty’s mom after dad put it together. “This is 
wonderful.” “Now where are we going to hide it until Sunday?” “How about in the attic?” 
“Marty won’t find it there.”</p>

<p>Sunday morning came and Marty was so excited about his birthday, he ran down the 
stairs into the kitchen. His gift was usually near his chair at the table, but this year he didn’t 
see anything. “Happy Birthday!” yelled mom and dad from the next room. They came into the 
kitchen and saw Marty was looking around for a gift. “I bet you think we forgot to get you a 
gift,” said mom. Marty looked confused. “Well, you usually put my gift in the kitchen,” Marty 
said. Dad told Marty to follow him outside to the side of the house. “This is fantastic!” yelled 
Marty. “I was hoping to myself that you would get the telescope.” “I don’t take many pictures, 
and I probably wouldn’t use the basketball much, and my bike is okay for now.” “But I will use 
the telescope!” “Thanks so much.” “You’re welcome,” said mom and dad. That night, Marty 
saw many beautiful stars and even the planet Mars. Marty loved his new telescope!</p>
