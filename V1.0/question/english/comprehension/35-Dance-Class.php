<p>Tara’s favorite class at school was dance class. It was an extra thing 
that her school did this year. They’d never done it before. It was a new 
experience for everyone. At first, she hadn’t thought she’d like it, but she 
decided to give it a chance.</p>

<p>It was weird to have to hold hands with a boy and dance. The steps 
were okay, and the music was okay, but boys were not really okay. The 
teacher was nice and funny, and she got them used to working together as 
a team. Then it wasn’t so odd working with a partner.</p>
<p>As the lessons went on and she learned new dances like rumba, salsa, merengue, and the 
polka, Tara really began to enjoy herself. Even being with partners wasn’t bad. In fact, she started 
enjoying dancing with partners who tried hard and knew their steps. Some of the boys thought it was 
just a joke, and they didn’t try hard. They wasted time joking and stepping on her feet. She hated 
dancing with them, but she politely took her turn with them anyway.</p>
<p>That was another thing she learned while she was dancing: to be a proper lady. She’d never 
thought much about it before, but the teacher expected her to behave like a lady, which meant she
had to accept dance partners and pretend to like it, even if she didn’t. That was being respectful and 
courteous. Just like life, you sometimes have to do things you don’t want to, the teacher had
explained. Yet, that didn’t mean she didn’t enjoy dancing with a boy who had the proper height and 
good steps to be a great partner.</p>
<p>As the classes neared their end, some twenty lessons later, Tara was delighted to hear she’d 
been selected as a finalist. That meant she would be representing her school. She’d wear a fancy 
dress and go dance at a competition. She and her partner, a great dancer named Todd, would be one 
of four couples from her school.</p>
<p>The competition was like something out of a storybook. There were dresses and shoes and 
music. Everyone was smiling, wearing great clothes, and hair was done nicely. Ribbons were tied and 
flowers were handed out. It was hard not to be nervous, but it was hard not to feel special, too. She 
and Todd, along with her teammates, danced their way through the competition. It was tough, and all 
the other dancers were so good!</p>
<p>It was sad not to win the competition, but a third place finish was respectable, something her 
school could work on next year. Maybe next year’s dancers would come in first place. Tara was proud 
of everything she’d learned. Her parents were amazed at how good she was. Maybe there was a 
career in this stuff. Who knew? She just knew she loved to dance, especially the Waltz.</p>
