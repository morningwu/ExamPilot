<p>Jamie got a new camera for her birthday. She had always 
liked taking pictures, but this was special. She was going on a trip 
with her family to Washington D.C. and down the east coast. Along 
the way, she wanted to take pictures to remember her trip.</p>

<p>The first place they stopped along the way was a beach in 
North Carolina. The sands were white and the water was clear. She 
took a great picture of the sky, the ocean, and the land. She really 
enjoyed swimming in the salty ocean water, too.</p>

<p>Next, they moved along to Washington D.C., where there 
were tons of things to see. There were monuments, museums, and 
all sorts of government buildings. She got a great shot of the capital 
building. It had very impressive columns and a very nice dome.</p>

<p>Then they moved on to some of the monuments. Some of 
them were in honor of some of our most famous presidents. Others 
honored the soldiers who gave their lives in wars. They were very 
beautiful and peaceful. It was hard not to fill up her camera with 
pictures of them.</p>


<p>With only a few quick stops in museums and at a few 
national parks on the way home, Jamie filled her camera 
completely. It was finally time to head home. It was hard to go, but 
she knew there would be more trips to wonderful places like 
Washington D.C., our nation’s capital. </p>

<p>Next year she hoped to go out west. She wanted to see the 
Hoover Dam and the Grand Canyon. Maybe she could see some of 
the Rocky Mountains or herds of wild buffalo. With a camera, there 
was no end to what she wanted to see, because each trip and each 
place was a new set of pictures!</p>
