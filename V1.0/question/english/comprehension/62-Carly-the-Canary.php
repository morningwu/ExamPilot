<p>Carly was a beautiful canary that had a black cage with 
green painted all around the bottom. Every morning Carly would 
sing a wonderful song. Jill knew when she heard Carly singing it 
was time to get up and get ready for school. Carly usually started 
singing around 6:00 in the morning.</p>
<p>This morning Carly did not wake Jill up. Jill rolled over and 
saw that her clock said 6:30. Oh no, thought Jill. I’m going to be 
late for school. Jill quickly rushed out of bed and got dressed.</p>
<p>Her 
mom was just waking up too. “We’re going to be late for school,” 
said Jill to her mom. “Carly didn’t sing and wake me up today.”</p>
<p>When mom got to the kitchen she saw that Carly was not in her 
cage.</p>
<p>“Jill,” mom yelled.</p>
<p>“Carly is not in her cage!”</p>
<p>“That’s why I didn’t hear her.”</p>
<p>“Where can she be?”</p>
<p>“She was in the cage when I went to sleep,” said Jill.</p>
<p>Just then Jill’s mom saw that the 
cage door was unlocked. </p>
<p>“Her cage was open and she must have flown out,” said her mom. </p>
<p>“She has to be in the house somewhere.”</p>
<p>They began looking all over the house, but no Carly</p>
<p>“Jill, you need to get to school.” </p>
<p>“We will look for her when you get home.”</p>
<p>Jill left for school 
but was not very happy. All day long Jill kept thinking where Carly might be. Did she fly out of 
the house? Did she get scared and go hiding under the couch? Jill found it very hard to 
concentrate on anything at school. All she thought about was Carly.</p>
<p>Jill rushed home. Mom was still at work. Jill looked all over the kitchen and then the
bedrooms. She checked under the tables. All of a sudden, Jill thought she heard a tweeting 
sound. That sounds like Carly, she said to herself. Jill listened again very carefully and started 
following the tweeting sound. It sounds like it’s coming from the garage Jill thought. Jill went 
into the garage, and Carly was sitting up on a high shelf in the corner. She looked a bit scared.</p>
<p>“How did you get up there?” Jill asked Carly. Carly just kept tweeting to her. Her mom came
home, and they went into the garage to get Carly. Mom was able to get Carly to sit on her 
finger and bring her back into the house and into her cage.</p>
<p>“I bet when I thought I closed the 
door all the way, it was open just enough for Carly to get into the garage.”</p>
<p>” I guess I didn’t close 
her cage all the way either,” said Jill.</p>
<p>Mom laughed and said, “At least she is okay, but I would 
set my alarm tonight if I were you.” Jill said, “I was thinking the same thing!”</p>
