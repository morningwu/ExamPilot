<p>Johnny never wanted to sleep again. “Sleep is such a waste of time!” He declared.</p>
<p>Truthfully, he was just really upset over missing a meteor shower last night. If he’d stayed up 
just an extra 15 minutes, he’d have seen dozens of bright streaks shooting across the sky. Instead, he
spent the time staring at the inside of his eyelids and drooling on his pillow.</p>
<p>“You have to sleep.” His father told him. </p>
<p>“No, I don’t. All the best TV is on late.”</p>
<p>“You mean the movies with bad words and too much 
violence.” </p>
<p>“Exactly!” Johnny agreed. “But night is the coolest. Owls 
and neat animals come out and play around, meteor showers 
happen, and you can study the moon with a telescope. What can I 
do during the day?”</p>

<p>Father smiled, because he had a lot of ideas about what 
should happen during the day: “Play soccer, play other sports, go 
fishing, read a book without a lamp, eat meals, and do chores.” </p>
<p>“I can play kick-the-can at night. That’s more fun than soccer or baseball. I can go night fishing 
and catch the big ones. I could just read a book on the computer or listen to my mp3 player. I could 
also eat snacks at night, and I could play instead of doing chores. There is no reason to go to bed.” </p>
<p>“How about your bedtime?” Father sounded like he was quickly getting tired of this debate.</p>
<p>“How about changing it?” Johnny suggested. </p>
<p>“Johnny, you have a bedtime because it makes sure you get enough rest. Without enough 
sleep, you’re sluggish and lazy all day. You can’t think well, and you don’t do good work. You certainly 
don’t study well if you’re tired. Besides, people actually get sick if they don’t sleep.”</p>
<p>That was a shocking idea. “You can get sick from not enough sleep?”</p>
<p>“Well, you go crazy first and start hearing or seeing things. Then you could eventually get very 
sick, yes. People were designed to work, eat, and rest. You can’t just cut out the rest.”</p>
<p>yes. People were designed to work, eat, and rest. You can’t just cut out the rest.” 
“I see.” Maybe sleep was necessary. “Could I at least stay up later on meteor shower nights or 
eclipses, though?”</p>
<p>“Sure. We’ll see about that. It is a good excuse to miss maybe an hour of sleep, but not all 
night.” </p>
<p>Johnny grinned. “That sounds great. I’m glad we had this talk.”</p>
