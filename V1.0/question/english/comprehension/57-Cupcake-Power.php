<p>Debbie smacked her lips as she chewed down on the last bit of her 
strawberry frosting cupcake. Off in the distance, she heard someone calling 
for her, so she went running.</p>
<p>“What is it?” She called out.</p>
<p>“It’s your turn to race!” Her friend Wendy told her. “Where have you 
been and what is that on your face?”</p>
<p>“It’s frosting.” Debbie replied. She wiped her face on her sleeve and 
ran across the grass to the starting line.</p>
<p>The other five racers grinned at her. She smiled back. She figured she 
must still have frosting on her face somewhere.</p>
<p>“ON YOUR MARKS!” The official shouted, raising the starting gun. Everyone got down in their 
starting poses low to the ground.</p>
<p>“SET!” All six runners lifted up off the ground.</p>
<p>“GO!” The gun cracked. All the runners took off from their starting blocks.</p>
<p>Debbie wasn’t sure what it was, but her first few steps put her out in front of the others. She 
kept her lead the whole way to the finish line. When she crossed the finish line in first place, she 
looked over at Wendy.</p>
<p>Wendy’s eyes were big and round. “Wow! Where did that come from?”</p>
<p>Debbie shook her head and laughed. “I’m not sure. Maybe it was cupcake power?”</p>
<p>Wendy frowned. “Cupcake power? Those things are not good for you. It should slow you 
down.”</p>
<p>“I think they’re my lucky charm. I’m going to eat one before the next race, too.” Debbie 
announced.</p>
<p>“Go ahead and try.”</p>
<p>Debbie and Wendy went off to buy another cupcake. In fact, she bought two. Debbie ate both. 
“One made me fast. Two should make me super fast!”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you full?”</p>
<p>“I fell really full.” Debbie groaned as she walked to the starting line for her next race.</p>
<p>This time, when the race started, Debbie came off the starting block slow. She came in last
place. When she finished, she was holding her side, because she had a cramp.</p>
<p>“So much for cupcake power.” Wendy said sadly.</p>
<p>“I think they have the power to help, or the power to hurt.” She rubbed her side. She was done 
with her races for the day.</p>
