<p>Jen was going to her first real pool party at Ashley’s house. Jen had always been shy about being seen 
in her swimsuit before, but she’d been exercising a lot. It was hard being the frumpy buddy of the popular 
girls, but she was ready to show them what she had worked at. She really felt like her awkward years were 
falling behind her. The growth spurt she’d had over the last year had caught her up in height to her 
classmates, so she wasn’t the shortest girl in class anymore. She’d also been practicing her swimming enough 
to not embarrass herself. All in all, it looked like a good opportunity to show off and have a good time.</p>

<p>All those hours of bicycling, lifting weights, and doing yoga had paid off. She pretty much thought it 
would all go right for her, but then she tried on her swimsuit. It didn’t fit! It was way too small. Of course it 
was! She’d grown nearly six inches in the last year and a half, and she’d not even considered her swimsuit. She 
couldn’t very well wear what she had. Even worse, borrowing one of mom’s matronly suits was not going to 
help. What would she do? It sounded like something only money could fix, and a trip to the store.</p>
<p>With her older sister’s help, she got to the local surf shop; it would cost her a favor later, but it’d be 
worth it. The store had all kinds of suits, from serious swimmer’s suits, to girlish sunbathing suits, to more 
boyish suits that covered up when surfing. What would be best? Several were eye-catching, but she needed 
the perfect suit.</p>
<p>She liked the one-piece swimmer’s suits, because they were sleek and cool looking, but if she couldn’t 
swim like a pro, there was no reason to dress like one. She also liked the surfer style, with longer shorts like a 
man, and a rash guard shirt that would cover her stomach and arms. Dad would certainly approve. Again, if 
she couldn’t surf like a pro, why dress like one? Besides, it was a POOL party, not an ocean surfing event. She’d 
get laughed at.</p>
<p>Finally, she settled on looking at the girly fashionable bikinis and onepieces meant for lounging around and splashing around in. She didn’t want 
anything too severe, because that wasn’t her style, and her father would kill her. 
She wanted something cute, with a touch of color to it, but it didn’t need to be 
like something her mom would wear, either. It had to say young lady, but not 
little kid.</p>
<p>Her eyes caught on a nice two-piece suit. It had some color and flirt to it, 
but would pass dad’s scrutiny, because he liked his daughter dressed decently. 
Her sister nodded and smiled. If Big Sis said yes, that had to be it. She grinned, 
tried it on, and bought it right away when it fit nicely.</p>
<p>he was a hit at the pool party. She fit right in, without feeling like the ugly 
duckling. Better yet, some of the boys even waved at her, instead of her friends. 
She didn’t have much time for guys with all her studies, but she didn’t mind 
having guys that were friends in class. They were useful when it came time to do science projects and algebra 
homework. Seriously, this was the best swimsuit, like ever…</p>
