<p>Mary and her sister Mina were very poor. They lived in a small 
town, and everyone knew they were poor. Most people felt sorry for 
them, but it wasn’t their responsibility to help the two girls.</p>
<p>The summer was hot and they didn’t have air conditioning. All 
they had was an old fan that overheated if it was plugged in for more 
than 15 minutes. They didn’t even have cold water.</p>
<p>Next door there was a watermelon farm. It was early in the 
summer, and there hadn’t been much rain. So, there was only one 
watermelon growing in the field. The watermelon was big and fat, getting fatter and riper every day. 
The farmer checked the melon every day. He was really looking forward to eating the first one of the 
season.</p>
<p>Every day on the way to school, Mary looked at the watermelon and thought how cool and 
refreshing it would be to eat it. The summer was so hot after all! </p>
<p>One day, Mary came home and the watermelon was sitting on their table, already cut open. 
Her sister Mina was already eating it. Sweet watermelon juice was running down her chin and she had 
the biggest smile on her face. </p>
<p>Mary and Mina ate as much watermelon as they could. They stuffed themselves until their 
bellies were full. Their refrigerator didn’t work though, so they had to throw out the rest, or flies 
would get it.</p>
<p>When the farmer checked his field that day, he became very angry. He had a good idea who 
had taken his watermelon. The farmer marched over to yell at the two girls for stealing his 
watermelon. When he banged on their front door, Mary, the younger sister, came to the door.</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir?” She asked innocently, but she looked guilty. She even had a watermelon seed stuck 
to her cheek! </p>
<p>The farmer opened his mouth to yell, but he couldn’t help but see 
how poor the two girls were. He saw the inside of their house and shook his 
head. He couldn’t be angry at them. “I just wanted you to know I found a few 
more watermelons starting to ripen. I’ll bring one over when it’s ready.”</p>
<p>“Really? Thanks!” Mary replied. </p>
<p>She looked so excited that the farmer felt good, even if his only 
watermelon had been stolen. At least Mary and Mina never stole from him 
again, because he always shared.</p>
