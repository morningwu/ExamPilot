<p>When Greg went to the giant aquarium near his house, he had one type of animal 
that he loved to watch. He liked dolphins and manatees, but he loved whales. Beluga 
whales from the arctic were really neat, but it was the Killer Whales especially that had 
his heart.</p>

<p>For hours, from the park opening until closing, he could watch them. Their blackand-white patterned skin reminded him of a tuxedo, a penguin, or even a zebra, but on 
the Killer Whales it seemed even more special. It made them stand out in the water. </p>

<p>Their playfulness and intelligence amazed him, too. He liked to watch the trainers 
coax them through jumps, leaps, and other tricks. They talked and squawked at the 
trainers. One time the trainer even got launched into the air off the Killer Whale’s nose. 
It was an impressive feat.</p>

<p>It always surprised him how fast and agile such a massive creature could be. He 
always expected them to be slow and lumbering, but they were fast like a bullet, darting 
through their huge tanks and exploding from the water. It also surprised him to learn 
that they were actually in the dolphin family, despite their name! They were closer to 
dolphins, and were more like cousins to whales.</p>


<p>In the park, they ate fish and other snacks, and lots of them. In the wild, he 
understood why they had their fierce name. They could eat seals, sea lions, small 
whales, and just about anything they could catch. Their teeth were sharp and predatory. 
They were the top of the food chain – even more 
dangerous than sharks.</p>

<p>The Killer Whales were amazing animals. They 
inspired him to learn more about the sea. He thought 
that some day he might want to be a marine biologist. 
Then, he could learn about his favorite animals as a 
job. </p>
<p>or now, he’d have to settle for watching them through the tank’s glass and 
reading about them. However, there was always the future!</p>
