<p>Susan was fourteen, but she had never been to another country before. Her 
father was going to Korea on business, so he let her come with him. She would 
have to spend some of the time in the hotel, but when he had time her father 
would take her out to do things. Her father had also mentioned that one of the 
other businessmen going had a daughter almost her age. They might be able to go 
do things together.</p>

<p>It was a long and tiring flight, but it was amazing to land in another country. 
It seemed a lot like home at first, because airports were all quite similar, but then 
she heard a lot of people talking a language she didn’t understand. When they got their bags and 
went to the taxi, all the signs were in Korean. It was interesting, but weird.</p>

<p>At the hotel, she immediately flopped on the bed and turned on the TV. Most of the shows 
were in Korean, but there were a few English shows that had been translated into Korean. She 
couldn’t read their language as it played across the screen. Their shows were very different!</p>

<p>While her father was at work, she ordered room service on the TV using the remote control.
She didn’t know the names of the foods, but they had pictures. She ate something called Kimbap, 
which was a little like sushi rolls. It wasn’t bad. It was fun to eat with chopsticks.</p>


<p>After work, her father took her on a tour of a palace. It was like a castle, with walls and guards 
and gardens. It was like nothing she’d ever seen before. They didn’t have places like that back home! 
It was so fascinating. She could imagine living there hundreds of years ago.</p>

<p>Then next day, the other businessman’s daughter, who was a fifteen
year-old named Mandi, came to say hello. She was a nice girl, and they quickly 
became friends. Together, they took some of the money they had been given 
by their parents and went to a store near the hotel. It was strange buying 
things that had such huge prices, like 15,000 Won. That was only like 12 
dollars, though. Shopping was fun in every country.</p>

<p>Together, they toured more with their fathers when they weren’t at work. They saw a temple, 
rode a train, went to a small island, saw people dressed in old-fashioned costumes, and ate lots of 
different foods. Things were very different, and while she didn’t like everything, she did enjoy trying 
new things.</p>

<p>Eventually, it was time to go home. Susan was sad to go, and sadder still to have to part ways 
with her new friend, Mandi. They exchanged phone numbers and said goodbye to each other, and to 
the country of Korea. </p>

<p>Susan wondered what country she’d visit next. She already had a few ideas!</p>
