<p>Meerfus the Magician had a rival in the wand-making business. Yes, he was probably the most famous 
wand-maker in the land, a magician of great renown, but he did have a rival: Milton the Green. Milton was a 
strange fellow, a magician in his own right, but really more of a mischief-maker and a wacky inventor.</p>

<p>Milton’s most famous invention was an Amphibious Assault War Vessel. This was 
a fancy name for a rowboat with two axles on the bottom and wheels. If the conditions 
were right, the people rowing the boat could catch enough wind in a sail and row fast 
enough that when they hit the land, they could keep going. The boat would just roll up 
on shore and the special oars could be used to keep moving along the land.</p>
<p>Milton’s normal crew consisted of goblins, which made poor rowers in the best of 
conditions. They often got stuck in the muck and sand at the edge of lakes and had to 
drag the boat out with ropes. Still, they did tend to strike terror in the small townsfolk, 
which allowed Milton to collect wand-making materials without much challenge. He was 
something of a bully.</p>
<p>Milton made lots of wands, often from cheaper materials. Many of his wands were used for mischief. 
He didn’t spend the time and effort to get high-end materials, but he sold a lot of wands. Unfortunately, many 
of his wands would not last long or would not work exactly as planned. You got what you paid for in magic and 
just about everything else.</p>
<p>Meerfus and Milton had a strong rivalry over their territory. They both 
wanted to sell wands, but Milton’s mobility as a traveling salesman meant 
that he reached more customers. Meerfus, on the other hand, relied on word 
of mouth. Many of his customers traveled to see him, because of good 
reviews from other customers he’d had. Reputation was very important.</p>
<p>In addition to that, Meerfus’ helper apprentice, Duncan, was fairly 
useful. He was beginning to learn the trade, and could generally follow orders 
without bungling them. Milton’s team of green goblins was pretty useless. It 
was a good thing there were lots of them, because terrible accidents often 
befell them when collecting Milton’s supplies. It was rather sad really.</p>
<p>Finally, Meerfus liked to fancy himself as being a bit more handsome than his rival. Milton had scabby 
skin, mostly on account of poor hygiene and associating with goblins. Goblins were known to carry ticks and all 
manners of diseases. Milton was also balding with a patchy beard. Meerfus had a rather magnificent beard 
himself, and was known to be complimented for it on a regular basis. It was curly, soft, and tied off with 
colorful strings or decorations to fit the holidays and seasons. This was not to mention that he was a snappy 
dresser, unlike Milton, who wore threadbare, stained rags for the most part.</p>
<p>Truly, Meerfus was the superior wizard in matters of fashion, appearance, skills, and professionalism!</p><hr/>
