<p>“What’s your favorite sport, Nick?” Ms. Rodgers asked.</p>
<p>Nick thought for a moment. Everyone in the class was looking 
at him. He was nervous. He needed a good answer. “I like soccer.”</p>
<p>Everyone smiled. A few people said, “I like soccer, too!”</p>
<p>That was a safe answer. Nick really liked Ice Hockey, but no 
one else in class liked it. He wished he could be honest, but he 
worried about what they would say. They would say things like, “Ice 
Hockey? Why?” or “What is that?” They didn’t know about it.</p>
<p>Nick came from Maryland. Up North, all the kids liked hockey. Down in Florida, kids 
loved soccer. He didn’t really understand why they didn’t like hockey. </p>
<p>He asked his dad when he got home. “Why don’t the kids here like ice hockey?”</p>
<p>His dad smiled. “Their families grew up watching soccer. They like soccer. We grew up 
watching hockey, so we like hockey.” </p>
<p>“They are so similar.”</p>
<p>“You’re right. They both have goalies. They both have nets. The scoring and penalties 
are nearly the same, too.”</p>
<p>“Hockey is inside in a cool arena. Soccer is hot and sweaty.” Nick sighed.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you invite a couple kids to the next game?” Dad suggested. “We will take 
them with us.” </p>
<p>Nick did that. He asked his friends Dave and Tommy. They did not know about ice 
hockey. They had never been to a game before. They were excited to see.</p>
<p>At the game, they had hot dogs and soda. They watched the game. Dave and Tommy 
asked Nick many questions about the rules and the teams. They watched with great interest. 
All of them had fun. </p>
<p>The next time at school when Ms. Rodgers asked Nick
what his favorite sport was, he said, “Ice hockey.”</p>
<p>Dave and Tommy grinned and said, “We like hockey, too!” </p>
<p>Nick was happy. He liked it when other people liked the 
things he liked. It made him feel like he had friends who 
understood him.</p>
